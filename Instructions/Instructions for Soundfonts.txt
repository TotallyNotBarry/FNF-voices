Sup,I'm Barry and I'm here to explain you how to use Soundfonts!

So,say hi to my soundfonts,I'm gonna explain a little about what's the difference between a soundfont and an .fst file,

Compared to what a Preset can do,you can put more than one character inside a soundfont,
because we are not talking about a scale,that is every sound sample put everything together inside one audio file,
we're talking about every sample already positioned in a note of the piano,plus the fact that since it's only one sample at the time,we can loop it.

Alright alright,so that was a brief explanation about soundfonts,now let's go on how to use them

If you know already how to use a Preset then this process it's kinda the same,
all you gotta do is grab the soundfont you wanna use,drag and drop it in open the channel rack in FL Studio,
after doing that,DirectWave will show up,telling you that you can enable 'Monolithic mode' in DirectWave's options,
if you don't do that after saving your flp next time you open it all the samples will be gone,
you can fix this by just drag and drop the same soundfont in the channel you put it in earlier,
and you're done.

You're probably someone I know so if you want me to explain this again just DM me in my Discord Barry#3381
