Sup,I'm Barry and I'm here to explain you how to use Slicex Presets!

So what I assume you're probably looking now all my .fst files,
these are really easy to use because I did all the work for you already,
all you gotta do now is open the channel rack in FL Studio,
after grabbing the .fst drag it inside the channel rack and then it will open Slicex,
when Slicex shows up all you're gonna see inside it is the chromatic scale of the character you chose,
and you're basically done at this point,save it as a preset in Slicex so you can use it in just few clicks after that.

You're probably someone I know so if you want me to explain this again just DM me in my Discord Barry#3381
